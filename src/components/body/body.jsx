          From our friends at the Yale Center for Environmental Justice The Yale
          Center for Environmental Justice is in the process of planning our
          fourth annual Global Environmental Justice Conference, with this year
          focusing on the theme of ‚ÄúEnvironmental Joy.‚Äù The conference aims to
          explore the ways in which environmental and climate justice and the
          communities engaged in that work generate joy. Guided by the notion
          that the ultimate goal of most environmental and climate work is to
          alleviate suffering and increase wellbeing, Environmental Joy will
          explore and celebrate the diverse ways that environmental justice
          achieves this goal. One facet of the conference programming we hope to
          organize is a juried art show soliciting works from artists around the
          world on the theme of Environmental Joy to be showcased in an
          exhibition during the conference. We are currently seeking any
          interested students or faculty who would be interested in supporting
          the planning and execution of this call for art. If you‚Äôre interested
          in learning more about the opportunity, please contact Julia Simon at
          <span className="font-bold"> julia.simon@yale.edu.</span>
